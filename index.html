      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p><img src="" height="200" width="150"></p>



<p>For computer as an essential element to our lives, I am facinated by both its capability and flexibility. As a keen to computer technology, I managed to complete many interesting projects (see Side-Projects for detail). During each of these projects, I found that my passion towards programming and problem solving grew profoundly. I am a Junior Computer Science undergraduate student at SUNY-Binghamton University, and I am a proud member of the Upsilon Phi Epsilon Honor Society. My biggest hobbit is to do everything I can to give back to the community. I volunteered to be a tutor for the Computer Science department in Binghamton Unversity, where I assist students to better understand their course topics. I was also a computer assistant that guidanced Binghamton residents who needed help with computers</p>
